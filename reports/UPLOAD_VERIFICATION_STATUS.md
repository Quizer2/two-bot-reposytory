# Upload Verification Status

## Overview
This log captures the verification results requested after the most recent set of
changes were merged into the working branch. The goal is to confirm that every
tracked file is in sync with the repository history and that the automated
checks continue to pass.

## Repository State
- **Branch**: `work`
- **Working tree**: clean (`git status -sb` returned `## work` with no pending files)
- **Latest commit**: `4fa18e86` – “Document correct merge choice for env helper”

## Validation Steps
1. **Repository integrity**
   - `git status -sb`
   - Result: no staged or unstaged changes detected, indicating that all files
     were committed successfully.
2. **Automated test suite**
   - `pytest`
   - Result: 95 tests passed, 1 skipped, 3 xfailed (expected failures). This
     matches the historical baseline for the project and confirms runtime
     stability.

## Conclusion
The repository state is consistent with the latest commit, and the standard test
suite completes without regressions. No additional action is required before
pushing or tagging the current revision.
